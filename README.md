# Boston-House-Data-Analysis-

## Introduction :

The Boston House Data Analysis involves exploring a dataset on housing in Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset includes various attributes such as crime rates, property tax rates, and accessibility to highways. The goal is to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques. Key steps include data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and interpretation. Ultimately, this analysis provides insights into factors influencing housing prices and helps stakeholders make informed decisions regarding real estate investments and urban planning.


## This project includes :

1. Data Loading,
2. Data Exploration,
3. Data Manipulation,
4. Data Analysis,
5. NumPy Operations,
6. Data visualization.

## This projest answer this questions :

1. Data Loading: Load the Boston Housing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Display the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.
2. Data Exploration: Use Pandas functions to explore the dataset. Find out the number of rows and columns, column names, data types of the columns, summary statistics, and check for missing values.
3. Data Manipulation:
* Add a new column to the DataFrame that categorizes the ‘medv’ (median value of owner-occupied homes) column into ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, and ‘High’.
* Replace the ‘chas’ column (Charles River dummy variable) with ‘Yes’ if chas = 1 and ‘No’ if chas = 0.
* Rename the column ‘rm’ to ‘rooms’.
4. Data Analysis:
*  Find out the average number of rooms (‘rooms’ column) per dwelling for each category of ‘medv’ (Low, Medium, High).
*  Find out the percentage of houses that bound the Charles River.
5. NumPy Operations: Convert the ‘age’ column (proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940) from the DataFrame to a NumPy array and perform the following operations:
* Compute the mean and standard deviation.
* Normalize the array.
